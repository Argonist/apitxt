	line	## Dictionary
	line	
	line	SignPuddle 3 organizes user dictionary elements into dictionary collections.
	line	Dictionary collections are available in three different forms: database, plain text files, and JSON objects
	line	
	line	### Databases
	line	
	line	Each collection is available as an SQLite database.
	line	These databases are the primary source and all edits are directly applied to the database.
	line	
	line	table entry  
	line	+ id  
	line	+ sign  
	line	+ terms  
	line	+ lower  
	line	+ signtext  
	line	+ text  
	line	+ source  
	line	+ detail  
	line	+ user  
	line	+ created_at  
	line	+ updated_at  
	line	
	line	### Plain Text Files
	line	
	line	Each collection is available as a plain text field where each entry occupies its own line.
	line	Each entry contains multiple fields that are divided by tab characters.
	line	The plain text files are designed for easy import and export from the databases.
	line	
	line	id /t sign /t terms /t lower /t signtext /t text /t source /t detail /t user /t updated_at
	line	
	line	### JSON Data files
	line	
	line	The dictionary JSON data file is an object.
	line	Each key contains an object with three properties: message, description, icon, and updated_at.
