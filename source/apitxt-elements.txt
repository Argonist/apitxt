group	elements	ApiTxt uses ten types of element to define an API.
	line	root, group, route, parameter, method, request, response, header, line, and code.
	line	
	route	/root	root
		line	Every document should start with a root element.
		line	After the root, the other elements are used to quickly create complex website APIs.
		line	The order of the lines matters and will effect the structure of the JSON objects.
		line	
		line	There are two groups of elements, the frame elements and the detail elements.
		line	The frame elements structure a website api and the detail elements attach to a previous frame element.
		line	
		line	### Frame elements
		line	There are six frame elements: root, group, route, method, request, and response.
		line	The lines are written in a specific order to create an array of JSON objects.
		line	
		line	**route organization**
		line	
		line	An ApiTxt document starts with a root, or an assumed root.
		line	Any route that occur before a group element, will be associated with the root.
		line	Groups are always associated with the root.
		line	Group elements can contain routes.
		line	
		line	```
		line	    root
		line	      | - routes
		line	      | - groups
		line	            | - routes
		line	```
		line	
		line	**route structure**
		line	
		line	A route can be associated with a variety of HTTP methods.
		line	Each method can have several requests and responses.
		line	Any response before a request will assume a generic request.
		line	Any response after a request will be associated with that request.
		line	```
		line	    route
		line	      | - methods
		line	        | - responses
		line	        | - requests
		line	              | - responses
		line	```
		line	## Detail elements
		line	There are four detail elements: line, code, parameter, and header.  The detail lines attach to a previous frame element if correctly structured.
		line	
		line	**single line elements**
		line	```
		line	    lines for all frame elements
		line	
		line	    parameters for route
		line	
		line	    codes for method
		line	
		line	    headers for request and response
		line	```
		line	
		method	GET	Get root definition
