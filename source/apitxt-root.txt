	line	ApiTxt is the build environment to create the SignPuddle 3 API for SignWriting Text.
	line	ApiTxt format is a highly structured plain text format that defines multiple facets of a website api.
	line	
	line	A variety of python programs and shell scripts are used to transform the source ApiTxt format into a fully functional and documented website.
	line	
	line	## Input and Output Formats
	line	The various formats are used to define the structure and function of a website API.
	line	The original source is written in ApiTxt format and transformed into an array of JSON objects.
	line	The JSON objects are used to write other formats, including API Blueprint.
	line	API Blueprint has an extensive toolkit of additional transformations.
	line	
	line	### ApiTxt Format (txt)
	line	ApiTxt defines a highly structured plain text format used to define multiple facets of a website api.
	line	Each line in an ApiTxt document is a self-contained element which starts with a name and is followed by &lt;TAB> separated fields.
	line	Writing ApiTxt documents is easier when tabs and spaces appear different, so use a plain text editor and turn on the invisible characters option.
	line	
	line	### Array of JSON Objects (json)
	line	Each line of ApiTxt format is converted into a JSON object or added to an existing object.
	line	The various objects are stored as an ordered array.
	line	The JSON array of objects can be reduced to the root object by appropriately structuring the groups, routes, and methods.
	line	
	line	```
	line	    root
	line	      | - routes
	line	            | - methods
	line	      | - groups
	line	            | - routes
	line	                  | - methods
	line	```
	line	
	line	
	line	### API Blueprint (md)
	line	[API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) is a high-level API description language for web APIs. API Blueprint is widely supported with various tooling available.
	line	
	line	### Stand-Alone HTM Documentation (htm)
	line	Stand-alone HTM document created from the API Blueprint using a template and the snowboard tool.
	line	
	line	### Interactive HTML API (html)
	line	Interactive HTML documentation is generated from the JSON elements.
	line	
	line	### PHP Server (php)
	line	The PHP server is written for the PHP project [Slim Framework v2](https://docs.slimframework.com/) to create the functional web API.
	line	The website directory contains an .htaccess file for an Apache server with PHP support.
	line	Alternatively, the server can be started with a shell script (start_server.sh) using PHP's built in web server and a custom rewrite.php file.
	line	
	line	## Transformations
	line	Python programs and shell scripts are used to read and write a variety of data formats including plain text, JSON data, API Blueprint, HTML and PHP scripts.
	line	
	line	### Plain Text to JSON Objects (txt2json)
	line	The primary transformation is from the plain text format to an array of JSON objects.
	line	
	line	### JSON Objects back to Plain Text (json2txt)
	line	The transformation can be reversed, resulting in a document that is properly structured with standardized indenting.
	line	
	line	### JSON Objects to API Blueprint (json2md)
	line	The API Blueprint document is created from an array of JSON objects.
	line	Each object is written as a section of the API Blueprint document using a markdown syntax.
	line	
	line	### JSON Objects to PHP Server (json2php)
	line	A functional PHP server is built from the JSON objects for the Slim Framework v2.
	line	The server responses can be based on prewritten responses or functional PHP code using URL parameters and query parameters.
	line	
	line	### JSON Objects to Interactive HTML Page (json2html)
	line	A functional reference guide with live calls to the server.
	line	Detailed reports for requests and responses.
	line	
	line	### JSON Objects to Javascript (json2js)
	line	The interactive Javascript for the user interface and the server calls.
	line	Detailed reports for requests and responses.
	line	
	line	### Snowboard Transformations ([bukalapak/snowboard](https://github.com/bukalapak/snowboard/))
	line	Part of the API Blueprint toolkit, snowboard offers three different transformations: lint, html, and mock.
	line	Snowboard lint will check the structure of the markdown text and report errors.
	line	Snowboard html will create a stand-alone html document using a template.
	line	Snowboard mock will analyze the responses of the markdown document and serve static responses over HTTP.
