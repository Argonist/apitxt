	line	ApiTxt format is a highly structured plain text format that defines multiple facets of a website api.
	line	
	line	A variety of python programs and shell scripts are used to transform the source ApiTxt format into a fully functional and documented website.
	line	
	line	## Input and Output Formats
	line	The various formats are used to define the structure and function of a website API.
	line	The original source is written in ApiTxt format and transformed into an array of JSON objects.
	line	The JSON objects are used to write other formats, including API Blueprint.
	line	API Blueprint has an extensive toolkit of additional transformations.
	line	
	line	### ApiTxt Format (txt)
	line	ApiTxt defines a highly structured plain text format used to define multiple facets of a website api.
	line	Each line in an ApiTxt document is a self-contained element which starts with a name and is followed by &lt;TAB> separated fields.
	line	Writing ApiTxt documents is easier when tabs and spaces appear different, so use a plain text editor and turn on the invisible characters option.
	line	
	line	### Array of JSON Objects (json)
	line	Each line of ApiTxt format is converted into a JSON object or added to an existing object.
	line	The various objects are stored as an ordered array.
	line	The JSON array of objects can be reduced to the root object by appropriately structuring the groups, routes, and methods.
	line

	line	      | - routes
	line	            | - methods

	line	The website directory contains an .htaccess file for an Apache server with PHP support.
	line	Alternatively, the server can be started with a shell script (start_server.sh) using PHP's built in web server and a custom rewrite.php file.
